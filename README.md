## Frederick Go's Portfolio

This is Frederick's new portfolio project with TypeScript. 

## Goals

The following are the technologies I am gaining exposure to through this project:
- TypeScript: I have self-taught React using JavaScript, and my primary objective in this project is to become proficient in TypeScript, which addresses the issue of website instability caused by inconsistent variable types in JavaScript, thus enabling more substantial development to be carried out in a more streamlined manner.
- NextJS: A meta framework I aspire to incorporate into my skill set.
- ESLint
- Redux

## Required installs
