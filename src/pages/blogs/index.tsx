                History is boring. But I must admit, when we study a technical subject, 
                learning the history and background it almost as important and useful as learning the practical aspect. 
                History not only gives us who came up with such inventions,
                but it also gives us why is was invented
                which tells us how we should apply it and the context:
                where we should apply this, how we should apply this, why we should apply this.
